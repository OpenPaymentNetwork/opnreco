1.2 (2019-02-05)
----------------

- Added support for a "sign" column on statement upload. Use + or -.
  Synonyms for + are credit, CR, C, and deposit. Synonyms for - are
  debit, DR, D, and withdrawal.

- A new period is now created automatically when setting the end date of
  an existing period.

- Added the unreconciled account entries to the period overview,
  but they are not included in the total, so they are grayed out.

- Exposed the version in the UI and link to the GitHub project.

- Allowed ctrl-click and shift-link on links (to open in a tab or window.)

- Removed support for creating account entries in the reconciliation dialog.
  The feature was confusing and redundant.

- Let users delete reconciled account entries (for consistency.)

- Fixed caching of the app by disabling the service worker; used ordinary
  cache-control headers instead.

1.1 (2019-01-24)
----------------

- Allow recos to span transfers.

- In auto external reconciliation, accept partial matches of transfer IDs.

- Allow "Vault Offset" reconciliation, which means circulation changed
  while failing to affect the account. This is a way to record the error while
  keeping the circulation and surplus totals correct.

- Stop accidentally redirecting to the latest period.

1.0 (2019-01-10)
----------------

- Initial release.
