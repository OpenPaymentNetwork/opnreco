1.5.3 (2019-03-13)
------------------

- Statement upload now allows an empty content type. (Sometimes
  browsers don't provide the content type.)

- When the user sets an end date for a previously open-ended period,
  and the app creates a new period, the app will now automatically
  pull movements and account entries into the new period.

1.5.2 (2019-02-19)
------------------

- Sped up verification by reducing the number of SQL round trips.

- Clear the verification state when switching profiles.

1.5.1 (2019-02-18)
------------------

- Corrected the internal state verification.

1.5.0 (2019-02-16)
------------------

- Added the Verify feature. It compares transfers previously downloaded
  with OPN. It also tests the internal consistency of the tool.

1.4.0 (2019-02-08)
------------------

- When the business has a circulation account, non-circulation accounts are
  no longer shown by default, to reduce confusion. There is also a setting
  to re-enable showing all accounts.

- There is now a report that shows the internal reconciliations for the
  current period. The report is linked from the internal reconciliation
  count in the period summary table.

- Fixed the flicker on the settings page.

1.3.0 (2019-02-08)
------------------

- Bundled transfers are now automatically reconciled.

- The spreadsheet parser now ignores leading and trailing whitespace
  in column header names.

- Allow reconciliations with more than 100 movements and/or account
  entries (the new limit is 10,000).

- The reconciliation dialog will no longer dismiss itself if you click
  outside. Also, the dialog now has a gray backdrop.

1.2.0 (2019-02-05)
------------------

- Added support for a "sign" column on statement upload. Use + or -.
  Synonyms for + are credit, CR, C, and deposit. Synonyms for - are
  debit, DR, D, and withdrawal.

- A new period is now created automatically when setting the end date of
  an existing period.

- Added the unreconciled account entries to the period overview,
  but they are not included in the total, so they are grayed out.

- Exposed the version in the UI and link to the GitHub project.

- Allowed ctrl-click and shift-link on links (to open in a tab or window.)

- Removed support for creating account entries in the reconciliation dialog.
  The feature was confusing and redundant.

- Let users delete reconciled account entries (for consistency.)

- Fixed caching of the app by disabling the service worker; used ordinary
  cache-control headers instead.

1.1.0 (2019-01-24)
------------------

- Allow reconciliations to span transfers.

- In auto external reconciliation, accept partial matches of transfer IDs.

- Allow "Vault Offset" reconciliation, which means circulation changed
  while failing to affect the account. This is a way to record the error while
  keeping the circulation and surplus totals correct.

- Stop accidentally redirecting to the latest period.

1.0.0 (2019-01-10)
------------------

- Initial release.
